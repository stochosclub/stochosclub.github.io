          <h2 id="collection-of-personal-information">Collection of personal information</h2>
          <p>You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any
            information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you
            wish to use some of the features offered in the Mobile Application, you may be asked to provide certain
            Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).</p>
          <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish
            content, or fill any forms in the Mobile Application. When required, this information may include the
            following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)</li>
            <li>Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)</li>
            <li>Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)</li>
            <li>Sensitive personal information (such as ethnicity, religious beliefs, mental health, etc)</li>
            <li>Certain features on the mobile device (such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take
            advantage of some of the features in the Mobile Application. Users who are uncertain about what information
            is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
          <h2 id="privacy-of-children">Privacy of children</h2>
          <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under
            the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. If
            you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through
            the Mobile Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child&#8217;s Personal
            Information from our Services.</p>
          <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&#8217;s Internet usage and to help
            enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile
            Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians
            overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed
            to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
          <h2 id="use-and-processing-of-collected-information">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
          <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered
            into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the
            data processor.</p>
          <p> Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the
            capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to
            ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data
            controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
          <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the
            Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal
            Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such
            instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
          <p>In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
            may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we
            request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information
            we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
            <li>Improve user experience</li>
            <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
            <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
            <li>Run and operate the Mobile Application and Services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services,
            where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for
            one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an
            agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for
            compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is
            carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is
            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also
            combine or aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and
            update our Mobile Application and Services.</p>
          <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
            processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we
            will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether
            the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary
            to enter into a contract.</p>
          <h2 id="managing-information">Managing information</h2>
          <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can
            delete may change as the Mobile Application and Services change. When you delete Personal Information,
            however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration
            necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described
            below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do
            so by contacting us.</p>
          <h2 id="disclosure-of-information">Disclosure of information</h2>
          <p> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you
            have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service
            providers (collectively, &#8220;Service Providers&#8221;) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the
            Mobile Application and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who
            agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally
            identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third
            parties.</p>
          <p>Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform
            services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they
            need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose
            any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
          <h2 id="retention-of-information">Retention of information</h2>
          <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary as long as your user account
            remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is
            required or permitted by law.</p>
          <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
            delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
            Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention
            period.</p>
          <h2 id="push-notifications">Push notifications</h2>
          <p>We offer push notifications to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. To make sure push
            notifications reach the correct devices, we use a third-party push notifications provider who relies on a
            device token unique to your device which is issued by the operating system of your device. While it is
            possible to access a list of device tokens, they will not reveal your identity, your unique device ID, or
            your contact information to us or our third-party push notifications provider. We will maintain the
            information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If, at any time, you wish to
            stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your device settings accordingly.</p>
          <h2 id="links-to-other-resources">Links to other resources</h2>
          <p>The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by
            us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third
            parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application and Services and to read the
            privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
          <h2 id="information-security">Information security</h2>
          <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
            unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
            safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
            Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless
            network can be guaranteed.</p>
          <p>Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are
            security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity,
            and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Mobile Application and
            Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in
            transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
          <p>As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you use to
            communicate with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please take appropriate measures
            to protect this information.</p>
          <h2 id="data-breach">Data breach</h2>
          <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised
            or Users&#8217; Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external
            activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
            appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to
            and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable
            efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as
            a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the
            Mobile Application, send you an email.</p>
          <h2 id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</h2>
          <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Mobile Application and Services at
            any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page, send you
            an email to notify you. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through
            the contact information you have provided.</p>
          <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy
            unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after the effective
            date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those
            changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially
            different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.</p>
          <h2 id="acceptance-of-this-policy">Acceptance of this policy</h2>
          <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and
            using the Mobile Application and Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this
            Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use
